<h3 class="tittle-1">RE: Eileen Dover university application</h3>
    <p>Dear Eileen,</p>
    <P>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty
     to study as part of your <abbr Tittle="doctor">PhD</abbr>next year. I will answer your questions
     one by one, in the following sections.</p>
<h4>Starting dates</h4>
    <p>We are happy to accomodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us 
    better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
    <p>You can find more information about <a href="https://www.thebridge.tech/" title="Universidad" class="link">university dates on our website.</a></p>
<h4>Subjets of study</h4>
    <p>At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-mind research facility - as long as the 
        subjets fall somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, 
        dedicated researcher, and just the kind of person we'like to have on our team. Saying that, 
        of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigued by are as follows, in order of priority:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H<sub>2</sub>O into wine, and the benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>.)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures excceding 30ºC(86ºF), when the audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3x10<sup>3</sup>>3x10<sup>4</sup>.)</li>
            <li><abbr Tittle="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr Tittle="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>So please can you provide more information on each of these subjets, including how long you'd  expect
        the research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to 
        know? Thanks.</p>
<h4>Exotic dance moves</h4>
        <p>Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, I <em>did</em> study exotic tribal dances.
        To answer your question, my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Polynesian chiken dance</dt>
                <dd>A little known but <em>very</em> influencial dance back as far as 300<abbr Tittle="before Christ">BC</abbr>, a whole village would dande around
                    in a circle like chikens, to encourage their livestock or be <q>fruitful</q>.</dd>
            <dt>Icelandic brownian dance</dt>
                <dd>Before the Icelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which
                        involved huddling close together in a circle on the floor, and shuffing their bodies around in imperceptably
                        tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired modem
                        styles such as Tweking.</dd>
            <dt>Artic robot dance</dt>
                <dt>An interesting example of histotic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have discovered
                        a new dance style characterised by <q>robotic</q>, stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants of
                        Northern Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this because
                        they were really cold.</dt>
